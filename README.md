# IS362_FinalProject

Final Project ProposalÂ¶For security reasons, the IT department of XYZ Company is responsible for generating and reviewing user information from of over 30 different standalone applications. Managers need to periodically review user access to ensure that only required personnel have active accounts at any given time. The applications have varied methods of generating a user list, and some are incapable of providing any list at all. For these applications, the only way to get the data would be to use a screenshot copied into a word or pdf file, or to manually type the information into a spreadsheet. For applications with up to 50 users, this can be quite tedious. My program will pull the user data from both a .pdf file and an access database, to represent the different output formats. The data will then be converted or parsed, into a common format (.csv). This will allow for automatic forwarding of the data to managers for reviews. I will create the 2 source files, modeled after a typical application user list.
